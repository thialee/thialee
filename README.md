- 👋 Hi, I’m @thialee
- 👀 Interested in education and learning. I enjoy reading, writing, and watching my crazy chickens. I try to learn something new every day!
- 🌱 I’m pretty comfortable with html5, css, and javascript. Now exploring Python and learning how to integrate all the things.
- 🙋‍♀️ I have lots of experience with WordPress and WooCommerce. Love being able to write my own plugins instead of buy--especially when I see the prices 🙈
- 📫 How to reach me --email is great!
